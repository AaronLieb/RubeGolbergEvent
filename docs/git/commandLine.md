# Git on the Command Line

## Cloning your fork

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your fork url>
```
Open the project in VSCode  
- File > Open Folder  

## Viewing your changes
```bash
git status
```

## Adding Files to a commit

```bash
git add <file>
```

Try to avoid using `git add .` or `git add -A`  
Individually add the files you want to commit.

## Commiting your changes

```bash
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
```
If you've made many changes, try to make multiple commits, with each commit containing code for a specific change

## Pushing your changes

```bash
git push
```

this will commit all of your changes to your fork
